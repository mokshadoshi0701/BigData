In this repository, for the assignment we included source code, data and a report using codelabs while implementing the following:

* Created data-as-a-service by using Fast API that can retrieve samples of different kinds from the dataset and designed five functions for that dataset

* Developed Model as a service for Linear Regression Model by passing in the inputs and getting prediction as an output

* Measured the Performance of the model 

* Test cases are written for the FastAPI using pytest
